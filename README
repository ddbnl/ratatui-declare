# ratatui-declare

Allows building Ratatui TUI's using declarative templates.

For example, four labels, one in each corner of the screen:
```YAML
Layout:
    direction: horizontal
    Layout:
        direction: vertical
        Paragraph:
            text: "{{hello}}"
        Paragraph:
            text: "{{world}}"
    Layout:
        direction: vertical
        Paragraph:
            text: "{{hello}}"
        Paragraph:
            text: "{{world}}"
```

Currently in development.
